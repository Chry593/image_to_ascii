Image to ASCII Converter
This project is a Python program that converts images into ASCII art. It utilizes the OpenCV library to process the image, transforming it into black and white and resizing it for a clearer ASCII representation.

Features
Converts any image to a grayscale representation.
Resizes the image to specified dimensions.
Outputs the ASCII art directly to the console.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV library
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copia codice
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-to-ascii.git
cd image-to-ascii
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copia codice
pip install opencv-python
Usage
Place your image file (e.g., prova3.jpg) in the same directory as the script.

Modify the img_load_resize function call in the img_to_ascii function to use your desired image and dimensions.

Run the script:

bash
Copia codice
python your_script_name.py
Functions
img_load_resize(path: str, height: int, width: int) -> tuple
Loads an image from the specified path, converts it to grayscale, applies a binary threshold to create a black and white image, and resizes it to the given dimensions.

Parameters:

path (str): The path to the image file.
height (int): The desired height of the output image.
width (int): The desired width of the output image.
Returns:

A tuple containing the processed image, height, and width.
img_to_ascii()
Converts the image loaded and resized by img_load_resize into ASCII art and prints the result to the console.

Example Output
When the program is executed, it generates an ASCII representation of the image, such as:
